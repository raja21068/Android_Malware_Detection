# Android-Malware-Detection
Android Malware Detection 
* The python scripts provide some functions to detect Android malware using static and dynamic features
* The several static features are used in the project are used in the classification; manifest features, method API features, method opcode features, shared lib. features, string features
* Classification of android apps done based on pseudo-dynamic analysis of system API Call sequences.
* Developed a Deep Convolutional Neural network (CNN) and a Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM) model.
* The main classification algorithm, the Multi- Layer neural network takes the static and dynamic feature vectors and perform the classification. <br/>
* Compared performance of these Deep Neural Network models with Naive Bayes , SVM, RNN , Random Forest Classifier.
* Developed an autoencoder model and fed the compressed representation to the CNN model .
